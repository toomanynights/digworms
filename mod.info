description=With this mod you don't have to dig hundreds of useless furrows and then eliminate each one with tedious context menu clicks. Two clicks - and your character will dig the same patch of ground until you decide you have enough worms (or until a stray zombie gnaws on their neck from behind). Balanced, vanilla friendly.
