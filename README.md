Dig Worms: a small Prozect Zomboid mod that allows you to... dig worms.

# Say goodbye to worm furrows.

Worms in Project Zomboid are versatile little fellows. You can use them as bait in fishing, in trapping, you can even eat them if you're desperate; they never perish, and then don't require crawling around "foraging" with crippled view cone, exposing yourself to a sudden bite from behind.

However, what they do require... is digging.

How many times did you dig furrows purely to get some worms? How many times have you been wondering why there's no "Remove furrow" cursor, and gone ahead removing them one by one via context menu?

If the answer is "one time too many", then this mod is for you.

# What does it do exactly?

It adds a new context menu option: "Dig Worms". Once you select it, your character will dig the same patch of ground until you decide you have enough worms (or until a stray zombie gnaws on their neck from behind). Zero unneeded furrows will be produced. Only worms and exhaustion.

You will need a shovel though.

# But is it balanced?

See for yourself:
-   One iteration of worm digging takes exactly as long as digging furrow and removing it would.
-   Calorie consumption is unchanged.
-   Exhaustion is unchanged.
-   Chance to get a worm per digging iteration is ~~unchanged~~ **slightly increased** when it's raining (because it makes sense).

One thing that's gone is monotonous button pressing. You're welcome.

# Still not convinced?

You can keep digging worms the old-fashioned way - but that doesn't mean I can't help you. This mod also adds a "Remove furrow" cursor.

From now on, "Remove" function, apart from just removing a furrow, produces a cursor that you can use to quickly remove furrows you don't need.

This mod is AI-translated to all available languages. I don’t have the ability to comprehend the quality of translation - but if you see that things don’t look right on your language, I’d appreciate your contribution.
